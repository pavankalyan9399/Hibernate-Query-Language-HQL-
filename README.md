# Hibernate-Query-Language-HQL-
This project demonstrates the implementation of Hibernate Query Language (HQL) for performing an update operation on a Department entity using positional parameters. The Department entity represents a database table with fields such as Department ID, Name, Location, and Head of Department (HoD) Name. The project is built using Maven and configured with Hibernate and MySQL for database interactions. The update operation is executed through HQL, allowing dynamic modification of records based on specific criteria, showcasing the flexibility and efficiency of Hibernate for database management.
